Biodiversity assessment aims at sampling individuals in collections and determining the number of species represented. Given that, by definition, samples are incomplete, these collections enumerate a lower number of the species actually present. The ecological literature dealing with robust estimators of species richness and diversity in collections of individuals is immense, and a number of useful approaches have been used to obtain such estimates [#Magurran:1988mm,Gotelli:2001uo,Hortal:2006dc,Colwell:2009gv,Gotelli:2011tb]. Recent effort has been also focused at defining essential biodiversity variables (EBV) [#Pereira:2013ji] that can be sampled and measured repeatedly to complement biodiversity estimates. Yet sampling species or taxa-specific EBVs is just probing a single component of biodiversity; interactions among species are another fundamental component, the one that supports the existence of species.  For example, the extinction of interactions represents a dramatic loss of biodiversity because it entails the loss of fundamental ecological functions [#ValienteBanuet:2014bw]. This missed component of biodiversity loss, the extinction of ecological interactions, very often accompanies, or even precedes, species disappearance. Interactions among species are a key component of biodiversity and here I aim to show that most problems associated to sampling interactions in natural communities have to do with problems associated to sampling species diversity. I consider pairwise interactions among species at the habitat level, in the context of alpha diversity and the estimation of local interaction richness from sampling data [#Mao:2005tka]. In the first part I provide a succinct overview of previous work addressing sampling issues for ecological interaction networks. In the second part I discuss specific rationales for sampling the biodiversity of ecological interactions.
